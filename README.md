# Tmux configuration

The configuration and plugins I use currently. Plugins are installed and managed with TPM, which you can install with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

The other added plugins are installed with `prefix + I`

The configurations have been taken mostly from https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io/tmux and I keep them under ~/.config/tmux/. The plugin vim-tmux-navigator needs to also be installed to vim/neovim.
